# CISC-480-Portfolio

Throughout my time at University of Saint Thomas, I have worked on many fun and interesting projects.
</br>
</br>
Some of my favorite projects can be found under the "Projects" page on my [Personal Website](https://nfriesen1.github.io/pages/projects.html) I made in my CISC 375, Web Development course.

    Set up the Lego Mindstorm Robot in "draw mode" giving it wheels and a set of rubberbands to hold a writing utensil
  </li>
    
  <li>
    While connected to the Lego Mindstorm Robot, download and run the above python script.  This will direct the robot to draw letters (currently will draw M -> I -> L -> E)
